 here is the updated CID-P UNIT CELL SPECIFICATION v2.0.

This version integrates the "Sim-Optimized" upgrades (Quasi-Crystal Lattice, Domed Intake, and High-Stiffness Material) directly into your established parameter list.

CID-P UNIT CELL SPECIFICATION v2.0

"Field-Hardened Acoustic Metamaterial"
Derived from Chiral Geometrodynamics

GEOMETRY_PROFILE:
 
  Type "Domed Reuleaux Triangle (Moth-Eye Gradient)" 


  Update: Replaces flat profile to create an impedance gradient, preventing the wave from reflecting off the shield face.

 
Packing_Strategy: "Penrose P3 Quasi-Crystal Tiling" 


  Update: Replaces "Honeycomb Tessellation". The non-repeating 5-fold symmetry eliminates straight "tunneling" paths for long wavelengths.



HELIX_PARAMETERS:

  The Torsional Transduction Engine
 
Chiral_Bias_Beta: 0.03 (Standard Grid Bias) 


 
Decay_Rate: 1.618 (Phi - Golden Ratio Taper) 


 
Draft_Angle: 1.325 degrees (Plastic Constant ) 


  Note: Critical for volumetric impedance matching.



  LAYER_STACK:

  The "Phase-Locking" Array
 
  Layer_1: "Left-Hand Twist Helix" () 



Gap: "Banach-Tarski Mixing Void" 


 
  Layer_2: "Right-Hand Twist Helix" () 



  PLENUM_CHAMBER:

 
  Type: "Toroidal XOR Logic Gate" 


 
  Function: "Phase-Conjugate Negation (Active-Passive Hybrid)" 


 
Intake_Angle: 109.5 degrees (Tetrahedral Lock) 


 
Termination: "Open Vent to Atmosphere" 



MATERIAL_REQUIREMENTS:

 
  Stiffness_Constraint: "Ultra-High (System Resonant Freq > 100 Hz)" 


  Update: Prevents sympathetic vibration with infrasound (0.1–20 Hz).



Recommended_Materials: "High-Density Resin, Ceramic-Infused Polymer, Cast Concrete/Gypsum" 


 
Wall_Structure: "100% Solid Infill (Microporous structures prohibited)" 



THEORETICAL_PERFORMANCE:

 
Target_Freq: "Broadband Infrasound (0.1 Hz - 20 Hz)" 


 
Mechanism: "Topological Heat Dissipation (Linear  Rotational Transduction)" 


 
Safety_Profile: "Passive / Non-Weaponized"
