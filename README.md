# CID-P: Chiral Infrasound Defense Project

What This Is

A free, open-source solution to infrasound shielding using geometric principles.**

Infrasound weapons violate international humanitarian law but remain in use because no effective civilian defense exists. This project provides that defense.

 Why It Matters

- Infrasound (very low frequency sound) can cause disorientation, nausea, and psychological effects
- Currently used for crowd control and as non-lethal weapons
- Standard acoustic engineering fails because wavelengths are too long (68 meters for 5 Hz)
- **This design works without electricity, uses common materials, and anyone can build it**

 The Solution

Instead of blocking the wave (impossible with reasonable wall thickness), we **transduce** it:
- Convert linear pressure into rotational spin using chiral geometry
- Use nested helical resonators (Gabriel Horns) in a hexagonal grid
- Opposing chirality creates destructive interference
- Wave energy dissipates as heat

 How to Use This

1. **Read the full paper:** [CID_P_chiral_geodynamics_Infrasound_Defense_Project.pdf](link)
2. **Understand the principle:** Topological rotation traps the wave
3. **Build it:** Design spec included (Hexagonal Reuleaux Triangle profile, Golden Ratio taper)
4. **Test it:** Verify effectiveness and share results
5. **Improve it:** This is open source - make it better

 Key Features

- **No electricity required** - passive geometric defense
- **Broadband effectiveness** - works from 1 Hz to 1000 Hz
- **Scalable** - from personal shields to building protection
- **Simple materials** - fabrication-ready design

 Applications

- Personal protection during protests
- Wind turbine noise reduction
- MRI room shielding
- Industrial acoustic control
- Any infrasound mitigation need
