🛑 The Problem
Infrasound weapons weaponize low-frequency vibration (0.1 Hz - 20 Hz) to bypass standard shielding. 
Standard Physics:** To block a 5 Hz wave, you need a 68-meter thick wall.
The Consequence:** Civilians are defenseless against state/corporate acoustic harassment.

 🛡️ The Solution
The Chiral Torsional Absorber (CTA) is a metamaterial shield derived from Chiral Geometrodynamics. 
Instead of *blocking* the wave (Mass Law), it transduces the linear pressure into rotational spin (Topological Damping) and cancels it via phase-conjugation.

> "If everyone can defend themselves, the weapon becomes worthless."

 🔧 How It Works
1.  Capture: The wave enters a honeycomb of **Gabriel's Horns (Fractal Helices).
2.  Transduce: Layer 1: Forces air to spin Left ($\beta_L$).
    Layer 2: Forces air to spin Right ($\beta_R$).
3.  **Cancel:** Both streams collide in a **Resonant Plenum, summing to zero momentum ($L + R = 0$).
4.  **Dissipate:** Any remaining energy hits the **Lebesgue Limit** of the tapered horn and becomes negligible heat.
